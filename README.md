### UI Automation & Docker Containerization

This repo extends the previous example of UI automation using Python and Selenium from [https://github.com/airpaio/ui-automation-docker](https://github.com/airpaio/ui-automation-docker). The code accompany's the second in a series of blog posts on monitoring and observability which can be found on [airpa.io](https://airpa.io).

Additions to this code which may be different from the repo at [https://github.com/airpaio/ui-automation-docker](https://github.com/airpaio/ui-automation-docker), include a custom collector of metrics for exporting to Prometheus. The actual Synthetic class from the previos repo is unchanged. Read more about it at [airpa.io](https://airpa.io).
